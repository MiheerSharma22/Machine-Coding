- need to implement timer / stopwatch
- in timer the user input is their desired amount of time for which the timer runs, once this time is over timer automatically stops.
- in stopwatch, once started it keeps on increasing the time in milli-seconds until stopped.
- both timer and stopwatch have two action buttons => Pause and Reset.
